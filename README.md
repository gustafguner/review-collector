Pull requests are often left hanging due to a lack of reviews. You end up
either flooding public channels with messages like "@here can anyone review this?" or even worse â€“ manually contacting each person asking them for a review.

With Review Collector, you don't have to do any of this. Review Collector is a Slack Bot that direct messages your colleagues when you request them to review a pull request.
